User ðŸ‘¤ : what employee has the highest salary in each department?
Agent ðŸ¤– (thought) : The user wants to find the employee with the highest salary in each department. I can do this by joining the 'EMPLOYEE' and 'DEPARTMENT' tables and using a subquery to find the maximum salary for each department.

Agent ðŸ¤– (tool_name) : IBMiTool
Agent ðŸ¤– (tool_input) : {"query":"SELECT E.EMPNO, E.FIRSTNME, E.LASTNAME, E.JOB, E.SALARY FROM EMPLOYEE E INNER JOIN DEPARTMENT D ON E.WORKDEPT = D.DEPTNO WHERE E.SALARY = (SELECT MAX(E2.SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE E2 INNER JOIN DEPARTMENT D2 ON E2.WORKDEPT = D2.DEPTNO WHERE D2.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO)"}
